# CNN-Android-Fruit_recognition

This project is a Andorid based fruit classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks.

The data-set used is Fruits-360 Data-set, which contains 120 different fruit and vegetables classes and different samples of 360 degree view of all of them. Earlier the dataset only had 60 fruit images, but now with the neew addition it hass grown to 120 and some vegetables hae been also added.

The project is based on creating a classification using CNN and then using the model in android to predict the image.
